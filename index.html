                    The term "Koryo Saram" (고려 사람) refers to a community of ethnic Koreans who were historically
                    deported or
                    migrated to various regions in Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.
                    The
                    name "Koryo Saram" translates to "Korean people" or "people of Koryo" in Korean. The Koryo Saram
                    community traces its roots back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when many Koreans migrated
                    to
                    the Russian Far East seeking economic opportunities. However, during the Soviet era, particularly
                    under
                    Stalin's rule, there were instances of forced deportation of certain ethnic groups, including
                    Koreans,
                    to Central Asia.

            <article class="deportation slide-left show-on-scroll"> In the early 20th century, prior to the separation
                of Korea, numerous
                North
                Korean
                farmers resided near the border of Russia and Korea; particularly in Vladivostok. In 1937 during the
                conflict between Russia and Japan, suspicions arose among Russian authorities regarding Japanese
                espionage
                efforts through Northern Korean spies. As a result, Stalin initiated a mass deportation of "targeted
                nationalities," alleging espionage and disloyalty. The harrowing tales of this period have been
                passed
                down
                through generations, including the fateful day when the Russian military ordered all residents to
                assemble
                at the town hall; those who dared to question or speak out were executed on the spot or were taken
                away.
                Subsequently, 171,781 Koreans were forcibly placed onto cattle cars set for Central Asia, enduring a
                cruel
                30 to 40-day journey marked by extreme hardships, resulting in the loss of over a third of their
                population.</article>

            <article class="document slide-left show-on-scroll">Following Stalin’s death, in 1953, the government
                initiated a process of political
                rehabilitation for individuals who had been unjustly repressed and prosecuted under false pretenses. As
                part of this initiative, a document was disseminated to all Koryo-Saram families, affirming their status
                as an oppressed group.

                challenges.
                Despite enduring harsh conditions, many survived with the assistance of Uzbek or Kazakh locals who
                offered
                them food and shelter. They managed to establish villages, known as Kalhoze. Within these
                communities, a
                cultural fusion emerged, blending Korean traditions with Uzbek or Kazakh influences and Russian
                customs.
                Unfortunately, with each generation, these traditions change or disappear. It is now the
                responsibility
                of
                the newer generations to uphold our cultural heritage and ensure its continuity through generations
