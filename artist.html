        <article> Koryo-Saram has always been deeply significant to me, as it represents a crucial
            part of both my identity and that of my family. I have never been able to fully relate to Russian or Korean
            culture, I've found myself inextricably linked to both, yet unable to fully identify with either.
            Information about Koryo-Saram, particularly our traditions, is scarce. Our ethnicity is slowly fading, and
            with each generation, our cultural heritage gradually disappears.
            Food is an essential part of any culture, it serves as an act of preserving and sharing culture.
            By sharing the history of my family, as well as one of the most traditional Koryo-Saram dishes, I am
            inviting others to delve into our unique cultural narrative. I hope to keep our traditions alive by bridging
            the gap between generations and across cultures.</article>

            Most of my sources have been stories that my family has passed down. My grandmother played a significant
            role in preserving these customs, and the photographs are from her personal collection, featuring our
            relatives. The recipes are a collaborative creation involving my grandmother and aunts.
